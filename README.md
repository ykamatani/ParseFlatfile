ParseFlatfile: Utility program to convert Illumina FinalReport file to plink binary file.
===

This is prepared to convert Illumina FinalReport file to plink directly, to accelerate the use of [RIKEN's BioBank Japan genotype data release](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0014-v10)

To compile program, simply do this

```
make
```

After obtaining FinalReport files, it is easy to convert them into plink format

```
ParseFlatfile --flat BBJ_OmniExpressV1_XChr_Cutoff_AB_20130611_FinalReport.csv.gz --make-bed --out BBJ_OmniExpressV1_XChr_Cutoff_AB_20130611
```

Do this for each file. Plink binary ped files are generated, and they can be processed by many genetics programs including plink.

The codes in writing plink binary file were largely derived from plink-1.07-src : http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/download.shtml
